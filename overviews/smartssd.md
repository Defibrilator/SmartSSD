# Samsung SmartSSD CSD

## Overview
This SmartSSD is the industryâ€™s first adaptable computational storage platform. The SmartSSD dramatically accelerates data intensive applications by 10X or more by pushing compute to where the data lives. This CSD is a partnership between Xilinx and Samsung and combines a 4 TB Samsung SSD with a Xilinx FPGA. With this FPGA, you can load an accelerator onto the CSD. 

The Xilinx Adaptive Platform is also available, a toolkit for creating customized, scalable applications to solve a broad range of data center problems.

## Hardware
Combines a Samsung Enterprise SSD and an acceleration-dedicated Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale+ FPGA with a fast private data path between them and a 4GB DRAM accelerator memory. Unlocks linear scalability while freeing CPU for other tasks as it removes the PCI-Express bottlenecks.

The FPGA provides logic elements and CPU cores for acceleration. The SSD controller provides the NAND media interface and management while a private, high-speed peer-to-peer link connects the SSD controller to the FPGA and transfers data between them.

## Environment
- Xilinx Vitis environment : 
	 A unified software toolkit that enables development in C, C++, or OpenCL. The Vitis platform plugs into common software developer tools and utilizes a set of optimized open source libraries.
-  Xilinx Run Time environment :
	Allows development in hardware description languages (HDLs), including Verilog and VHDL. Also simplifies the re-use of existing accelerator IP designed in HDL for ASICs or FPGAs.

## Target Applications
*Best for data-intesive applications.*
AI/ML Inference, Big Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Lake/DB Acceleration, Data Warehousing, Encryption/Decryption, Financial Services, Genomics, Search Queries, Storage & Virtualization, Transparent Compression, Video Analytics, Video File Transcoding

## Solutions 
#### 1. XSS:dm-crypt Acceleration
XSS turns this platform into turnkey accelerated offloads for existing Linux storage software.

XSS:dm-crypt is an AES-XTS encryption and decryption accelerator for data read from or written to the SmartSSD. You can use the Linux kernel module DMCrypt which maps block IO requests through a transparent encryption function between the IO requestor and the block storage device.
